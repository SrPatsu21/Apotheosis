# What Still Needs To Be Done

## 0. Set the license ✅

[LICENSE](./LICENSE)

## 1. Define the main idea ❎

### Today

- Roguelike/Soulslike
- 2.5D
- Rebirth
- procedural map
- random mobs
- do not lose items
- some action to level up, sleep, eat, rest
- punishment for death is losing xp and maybe more
- Every time you update, you can choose an attribute, attributes must be very generic

### Future

- after death, undead debuffs, something like that
- proficiency with each type of weapon gives different abilities, but the xp level is the same
- DNA system

## 3. Define the libs and set how to use them

## 4. Set the makefile

## 5. config gitignore

## 6. Define a name

## 7. What next?
