## Server Policy

This project allows the creation and operation of third-party, community-run multiplayer servers.

### Unofficial Servers

- Server operators are solely responsible for their servers, including content, moderation, monetization, and legal compliance.

### Content
- The project maintainers are not responsible for user-generated content or server-specific rules.
- Server operators must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

  - Loot boxes, crates, or similar mechanics purchased with real money.
  - Loot boxes or chance-based mechanics purchased using in-game currency that is directly or indirectly acquired with real money.
  - Betting, wagering, or raffles involving items, currency, or services with real-world monetary value.
- Server operators are solely responsible for ensuring their monetization models comply with applicable laws and regulations.
- Monetization must not imply official endorsement or affiliation.

### Branding
